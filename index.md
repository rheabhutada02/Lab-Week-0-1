##### Hi, I'm **Rhea**! I am a third-year pursuing a *major in Computer Science* and *a minor in Cognitive Science*. I've been programming for the past few years and ~~still have no idea what I'm doing~~ have come to enjoy my experience so far. My favorite programming language is Python, ***DUHHH***, due to its emphasis on natural language. Besides programming, in my freetime I love to stay active by going on runs and hikes <sub>sometimes it's hard to find time though</sub>. I also love listening to music, watching movies, and hanging out with my friends.

## Life Lesson
An important lesson that I have learned in my as a programmer is that one should never run ```rm -rf /``` in their command prompt. This will delete **_EVERYTHING_**. You can find more information on deadly commands that should never be written in the command prompt on this [***website***](https://www.howtogeek.com/125157/8-deadly-commands-you-should-never-run-on-linux/).
